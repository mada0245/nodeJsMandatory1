    <h3>1 - This is how to use git in a project:</h3>
    <p>("mkdir folderName") -> Create a new project folder</p>
    <p>("cd folderName") -> Go to project directory</p>
    <p>("git init") -> Initialize a Git repository</p>
    <p>Create a new repository on github and copy the repositoryURL</p>
    <p>("git remote add origin repositoryURL") -> Add the remote repository to your local Git repository</p>
    <p>("touch fileName" + ".fileExtention") -> Create a file</p>
    <p>("git add filName" + ".fileExtention" || "git .") -> Stage the changes of a file or all files in the directory</p>
    <p>("git commit -m "message"") -> Commit the staged changes</p>
    <p>("git push -u origin main") -> Push changes</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>2 - This are the data types in javascript:</h3>
    <h4>Primitive data types :</h4>
    <p>Number : represents number</p>
    <p>String : represents text</p>
    <p>Boolean : represents true or false</p>
    <P>Null : represents abscence of object</P>
    <p>Undefined : represents abscence of value</p>
    <p>Symbol : reprresents unique identifire</p>
    <h4>Object data types : Can contain any combination of primitive data types and other objects </h4>
    <h4>Function data types : Are objects that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values</h4>
    <h4>Array data types : Store any cobination of data types and objects</h4>
    <p>BigInt data types : Represent very big Intengers that pass the max sizy of, number data type</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>3 - About node.js</h3>
    <p>Node.js is a server-side runtime environment build on v8, google chrome javascript engine.</p>
    <p>It is used to build web applications that have big performance and are very scalable</p>
    <p>In it is only used java script to build the code which means other languages will not be necessery back or front end</p>
    <p>Node.js has a big set of lybraries that can be used and it is also know to be very scalable and quick becaouse has a non-blocking I/O which, with, can handel many request at once.</p>
    <br>
    <br>   
    <h3>4 - This is how to design a REST API with express in Node.js</h3>
    <p>("npm init -y " , "npm install express") </p>
    <p>make a js file file named app</p>
    <h4>In app.js :<h4>
    <p>("const express = require("express");")</p>
    <p>("const app = express();")</p>
    <p>("
        app.get("/link", (req, res) => {
        res.send({ /*code*/ });
        });
        
    ") -> get something from the server</p>
    <p>("
        app.get("/link/:id", (req, res) => {
        /*code*/
            res.send({ /*response code*/ });
        });
    ") -> get something from the server by id</p>
    <p>("
        app.post("/link/post", (req, res) => {
            /*code*/
            res.send({ /*response code*/ });
            });    
    ") -> post something to the server</p>
    <p>("
        app.patch("/link/:patch", (req, res) => {
            /*code*/
            res.send({ /*response code*/ });
            });    
    ") -> patch something from the server by id</p>
    <p>("
        app.delete("/link/:delete", (req, res) => {
            /*code*/
            res.send({ /*response code*/ });
            });    
    ") -> delete something from the server by id</p>
    <p>("
        app.listen(8080, () => {
            console.log("Server is running on port", 8080);
        });    
    ") identify the server port and print he message when it is running</p>
    <br>

    <h3>5 - Why is clean code convetion good ?</h3>
    <p>Clean code makes everything easiear to find. It is more pleasable to read and bugs are easier to be identyfied and fixed.</p>
    <p>If everything is a mess, the developer has more difficulties to work and it is very hard for the code to be passed to somone else or to be reused</p>
