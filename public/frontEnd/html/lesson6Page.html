    <h3>1 - Diffrence between client-side redirection and server-side</h3>
    <p>Are two different ways of redirecting from one web page to another</p>
    <h4>This are the diffrences between the two: </h4>
    <p>In client-side redirection, the redirection code is executed in the browser, while in server-side redirection, the redirection code is executed in the server</p>
    <p>In server-side redirection, the owner has more control over the redirection process, as the server can make rules and verifications before redirecting</p>
    <p>Server-side redirection is the preferred, as it provides better control</p>

    <h3>2 - How do i thing is better to structure the frontend and html pages</h3>
    <p>I would say it is for the best to avoid repeatable code, as much as possible, beacouse it is a big waste of time</p>
    <p>Do as many modules and global resusable code as possible</p>
    <p>Always have a global css and global js files with code that is necssary in more than a page</p>
    <p>Whn writhing your code make it clean and organized and comment always is thought necessary</p>
    <p>When commiting inser meaningful messages about what has been changed. Make planty of commits with meaningfull changes but not too large, devide big changes in many commits </p>
