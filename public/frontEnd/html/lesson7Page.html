    <h3>1 - SSR vs CSR</h3>
    <h4>SSR</h4>
    <h4>+</h4>
    <p>Faster in slow devices: because the initial HTML is loaded from the server</p>
    <p>Better accessibility</p>
    <p>Can provide better SEO results because search engines can crawl and index the pages more easily</p>
    <h4>-</h4>
    <p>Increased server load</p>
    <p>Pages that requiere a round trip to the server may have a slower load</p>
    <p>Can be more complex to implement and maintain because it requires additional server-side configuration and setup</p>
    <h4>CSR</h4>
    <h4>+</h4>
    <p>Faster page loads because the initial HTML is loaded fast and the JavaScript code takes over to render the page dynamically</p>
    <p>It allows for dynamic updates without the need for page refreshes</p>
    <p>Easier and more flexible maintenance and development</p>
    <h4>-</h4>
    <p>SEO challenges, search engines may not be able to crawl and index the pages properly</p>
    <p>Performance issues on slow devices</p>
    <p>CSR can be less accessible because the initial HTML is not available to users who have limited access to JavaScript</p>

    <h3>2 - What couses XSS and how sanitaize using npm package</h3>
    <p>XSS occurs when an someone is able to insert malicious code into a web page that is then executed by a user's browser</p>
    <p>This can happen in many ways, like inserting code into form fields, URL parameters, or cookies</p>
    <h4>Using npm package</h4>
    <p>("npm install xss") -> install xss package</p>
    <p>In the js file:</p>
    <p>("const xss = require('xss');")</p>
    <p>Then use the xss fuction to sanitaize the inputs</p>
    <p>("
        const input = "alert('XSS PROBLEM')";
        const sanitaizedInput = xss(input);
        console.log(sanitaizedInput);   
    ")</p>
